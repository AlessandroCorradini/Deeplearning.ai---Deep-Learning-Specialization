# Convolutional Neural Networks from Deep Learning Specialization
This repository contains all programming assignments solutions for the [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) taught by the legendary prof. Andrew Ng.

This course cover:
- Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
- Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
- Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
- Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.
