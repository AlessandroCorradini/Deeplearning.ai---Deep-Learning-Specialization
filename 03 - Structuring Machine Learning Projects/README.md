# Structuring Machine Learning Projects from  Deep Learning Specialization
This repository contains all programming assignments solutions for the [Structuring Machine Learning Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning) courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) taught by the legendary prof. Andrew Ng.

This specialization cover:
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and 
- Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
- Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
- Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning


## Certificate of Completion
You can see the [Certificate of Completion](https://github.com/AlessandroCorradini/Certificates/blob/master/Coursera%20-%20Structuring%20Machine%20Learning%20Projects%20Certificate%20-%20Deeplearning.ai.pdf) and other certificates in my [Certificates Repo](https://github.com/AlessandroCorradini/Certificates) that contains all my certificates obtained through my journey as a self-made Data Science and better developer.
