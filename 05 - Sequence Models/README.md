# Sequence Models from Deep Learning Specialization
This repository contains all programming assignments solutions for the [Sequence Model](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) taught by the legendary prof. Andrew Ng.

This course cover:
- Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs.
- Be able to apply sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis. 
- Be able to apply sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis.


## Certificate of Completion
